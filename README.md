## UMKC CS461 - Simulated Annealing Project
This project is a learning for COMP-SCI 461: Introduction to Artificial Intelligdence at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

### Project Description
Using Visual Studio and C++, this program will generate an optimized class schedule using simulated annealing.
Provided only simple conditions and their respective weights measured in integer values, we were expected to research the technique ourselves and
implement it with whatever environment/language we were most comfortable with.

### Technology Used
Visual Studio 2017
